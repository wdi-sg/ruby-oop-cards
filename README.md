Create a game of cards using ruby objects.

1. Create a card class that, when you initialize it, creates an array of "cards" that are of value 1-52.

1. Create a game class that uses the card class to play a game.
  - when you play the game, draw two cards from the deck.
  - if the player has the highest card, give them a point.
  - if the player doesn't have the highest card, deduct a point.
  - if the player's score is less than -2, end the game.

1. Inside the game class, keep a record of each hand played in an instance variable array.

1. show the score to the player

### Hints:
- Use `gets.chomp` to get input from the user.
- Use a while loop for each turn of the game.
- Look in the `solution/play.rb` if you're not sure how to write the game loop
- Look in the solution class files if you forget the syntax of ruby classes

Ask the player for their name at the beggining of the game, and print it out at each turn.
Example: "hello Ray, you have 10 points."

# further
On each turn, ask the player if he wants to continue with the game.
If he says no, end the game and output the final score.

# further
Implement betting inside the game class.
Before each turn allow the user to make a wager from his current points.

Change the card class to reflect an actual deck of cards.
You can choose to make each card a class instance if you want.
You will have to change the winning card logic.
You can use these rules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_card_by_suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_card_by_suit)
